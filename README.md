Project Description — i-Note

i-Note is a full-stack personal notes and code-snippet manager built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack. It allows users to securely create, update, store, and manage their daily notes or programming snippets in an organized and user-friendly interface.

The application includes authentication, dynamic CRUD operations, and a clean UI optimized for productivity. Users can quickly paste code, preserve formatting, copy snippets, and expand long content using a “Read more / Show less” feature.
